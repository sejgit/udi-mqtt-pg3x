node MQFlag

This node is intended as a flag for a sensor or condition on an IoT device,
allowing the device program, rather than the ISY, to control the state.

FLAG-0 = OK
FLAG-1 = NOK
FLAG-2 = LO
FLAG-3 = HI
FLAG-4 = ERR
FLAG-5 = IN
FLAG-6 = OUT
FLAG-7 = UP
FLAG-8 = DOWN
FLAG-9 = TRIGGER
FLAG-10 = ON
FLAG-11 = OFF
FLAG-12 = ---

Payload is direct (like a switch) not JSON encoded (like a sensor).
Example device: liquid float {OK, LO, HI}
Example condition: IOT device sensor connections {OK, NOK, ERR(OR)}
